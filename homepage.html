  <body style=background-color:#c2e1ed>
    <!--Inside the body tag, I included the style tag and specified that I was changing the background colour. I set it to one I liked using its hex code.  -->
    <h1 style=text-align:center>Ben Strahan's Page</h1>
    <img src="me.jpg" alt="This is a photo of Me" height=400 width=400 align=right rotate="90">
    <!--Here, I used the img tag to insert this photo of me. The heght and width tags were used to make the image fit on the page.
  The allign tag is used so that my image is pushed to the right of the test, so that I have my text alongside of the image instead of beneath it.
I did have an issue trying to make the photo appear the correct orientation. I tried using the "rotate" tag, and ohers, but none made a change.  -->
<a href="test.html">My Cat</a>
<!--The "a" tag anchors the words "My Cat" with the link to the page displaying a photo and info about my cat. -->
<br>
<br>
<!-- The "br" tag was used to create a break in the page to space the information out from the previous line to be easier to read -->
<p>
<b> Arbitrary list: </b>
<!-- The "b" tag is used to bold the text that it stands out more than the list. It generates a heading effect without using the "h$" tag, which enlarges the text.  -->
<ol>
  <li>number 1</li>
  <li>number 2</li>
  <li>number 3</li>
</ol>
<!--I used the emmet package to make writing this list easier, the ordered list, "ol" tag was used along with the list item,"li" tag. (ol>li{number $}*3) was used to make the list. The brackets indicate text, and the "$" indicates that the correspoding number to the list item should be inserted in the text.   -->
<b> My favourite websites:</b>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://youtube.com">Youtube</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a></li>
</ul>
<!--I used almost the same code here as the previous list. instead of the "ol" tag I used the "ul" tag, for an unordered list. I used emmet to shorten the process; (ul>li{a}*3). Inside each of the anchors I inserted a link corresponding witht he text outside of the quotes.  -->
