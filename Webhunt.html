    <h5>Opacity</h5>
    <p>the opacity aspect can be used as a standalone property or inside the HSLA value. It takes a value between 0 and 1. 1 meaning the image is solid and 0 meaning it is totally transparent. I used the opacity affect along with the hover selector to make the above image become more transparent when hovered over. </p>

<h5>
  Rgb Values
</h5>
<p> an rgb value is a value made up of three numbers, up to 255 that represent the <span class=red>red</span>,<span class=green> green</span> and <span class=blue>blue</span> attributes of the item</p>

<h5>Hex Codes</h5>
<p>A hex code is a six digit code that references one specific colour. I used a hex code to define the background colour of <span class=hex>this</span>. </p>

<h5>Hue</h5>
<p>hue is part of a three input HSL colour value. H in HSL stands for hue. The hue is the degree on the colour wheel. 0 being red, 120 being green, 240 being blue. </p>

<h5>Saturation </h5>
<p>Saturation is the second input in the HSL value. it is a percentage value. )% means a shade of grey, whereas 100% is the full colour</p>

<h5>Brightness (lightness?)</h5>
<p>lightness/brightness is the third input for a hsl value. it is a percentage, 0 being black and 100 being white. I used the H,S,L value to define the background colour of this page. </p>

<h5>Contrast</h5>
<p>Contrast is the difference between the foreground and background colours. higher contrast generally means the text is easier to read. I checked my contrast for my foreground and background and found the contrast ratio to be 10.62 </p>

<h5>CSS3 HSLA</h5>
<p>CSS3 is the latest form of the cascading style sheet language. HSLA is similar to the HSL format but allows for a fourth option, being alpha, or opacity. I used HSLA to change the opacity and colour of <span id=this1>this</span></p>
